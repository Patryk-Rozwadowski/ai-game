# My first genetic algorithm made in vanilla javascript

Remember game Pong? Now we can watch how genetic algorithms can handle it!

Genetic algorithm's short explanation from wikipedia:

> In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.

Ui params explanation:

- Generation - stands for number of reproduction
- Best fitness - best score in it's generation
- Worst fitness - worst score in it's generation
- Average fitness - average fitness from whole population 
- Best ball hit - the best number of the number of balls to be bounced
- Mutation ratio - chance for mutations for a single unit in the population
